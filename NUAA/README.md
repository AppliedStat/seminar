## Title: Quality Control with Unequal Sample Sizes
Hosted by Dr. Ouyang,  College of Economics and Management, 
Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China  (December 3, 2020). 

### Abstract 
Motivated by the construction of Shewhart-type control charts with unequal
sample sizes, we provide several estimators which are needed to estimate
process parameters.  When samples are unbalanced, special cares should be
taken to ensure the unbiasedness of estimators.  We consider incorporating
the proposed method into the control charts.  The usual requirement under
the control charts is that the sample sizes of subgroups are all equal
(balanced) under the normality.  In practice, however, it is often the case that
the samples are not balanced.  There exist several ad-hoc methods to
handle the case of unbalanced samples.  However, these ad-hoc methods
are biased, which can result in underperformance.

In this talk, we suggest several unbiased estimators and provide
the rigorous proofs of the inequalities needed for selecting an
estimator.  The proofs reveal an interesting and useful connection
between the statistical and mathematical theories.  For example,
the normal-consistency factor c4 can be expressed using the Wallis'
production formula calculating pi and the Watson representation.

In addition, we also consider the issues when the normality assumption
is violated.  Time permitting, we will discuss how to apply the proposed
methods in other applications such as robust design.
